# Card design

- power assignment in steps of 500. Prefer full thousands instead of 500's
- Extra 500 is a way to "power creep" an otherwise weak looking car a bit of a boost so it trades up
- Don't assign this power creep from 500 to next thousand.

- when a spell does something twice, you can discount the repeat effect. See `Raise The Dead`

- spell average strength: 1 resource kills 1000 power. Conditionally stronger. Calculate and test average effect of spell

- 1000 power = 1 resource (less than 2000 is worth less)
- card draw = 1 resource
- fragile = -1 resource
- revive = 3 resource (always with fragile if creature effect to avoid infinite value!)
- blocker = 0.5 resource
- add protection = 2 resource
